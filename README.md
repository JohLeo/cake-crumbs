## Be my valentine! ‚ù§Ô∏è
The idea with this project was to be creative, have fun and practise my skills in **React** and **Typescript**. I wanted to build it like a small treasure-hunt, making the reciever search for some breadcrumbs to be able to move to the next step. 
I sketched up the design and each of the steps in **Figma**. I also created a gameplan for what would happen on each page, with the purpose that the function itself should challenge me code-wise.

I started setting up the basic structure and from there I went on page by page.
After a while I realised that if my purpose was and ask someone out, creating to many secrets and breadcrumbs might make it to hard and leave me without an actual date. 
Therefore I simplified the treasure-hunt and created tiny stupid(fun!) features on each page instead. 

If I would give this project more time, I would add more of a treasure-hunt after all, and include some more css created animations to make it more dynamic. 

[!IMPORTANT]
Since I wanted it to feel somewhat oldschool, I made the descision to not make this adapted to mobile. Might fix that in the future. 
Also, as always, it works the best in Chrome or anything but Safari ü§ì
