## Be my valentine! ❤️
The idea with this project was to be creative, have fun and practise my skills in **React** and **Typescript**. 
I wanted to build it like a small treasure-hunt, making the reciever search for some breadcrumbs to be able to move on. 
I sketched up the design and each of the steps in **Figma**. I also created a gameplan for what would happen on each page, with the purpose that the function itself should challenge me code-wise.

I started setting up the basic structure and from there I continued with a page by page approach.
After a while I realised that creating to many secrets and breadcrumbs might defeat my purpose(to ask someone out) by making it to difficult and could leave me without an actual date!
I therefore simplified the treasure-hunt and created tiny ridiculous features on each page instead. 

If I would give this project more time, I would add more of a treasure-hunt take on it after all, and include some more css created animations to make it more dynamic.

> Since I wanted it to feel somewhat oldschool, I made the descision to not make this responsive to mobile. Might fix that in the future. 
Also, as always, it works the best in Chrome or anything but Safari 🤓
